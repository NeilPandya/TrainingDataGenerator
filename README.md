# TrainingDataGenerator

For machine learning purposes, this python script creates circles with bounding boxes, and accompanying annotations in the PASCAL VOC format. Intended for use with darkflow (https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow.git), a "YOLO" object-detector based on the darknet framework, and uses tensorflow as the backend.
